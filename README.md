# self-hosted-gpt
Self-host ChatGPT with GPT3.5/GPT4 using your own API key

## Why?
- GPTPlus costs $20 a month.
- With an API Key,it costs $0.06 per 1K tokens (at 32K context).
- To reach $20, you need to use $20/$0.06 = 333.333 * 1K tokens = 333K tokens.
- Unless you REALLY use chatGPT like crazy, you will not reach that number.

Bonus: If you don't care about 4, and just want GPT3.5, now it costs $0.002 per 1K tokens, which means you'll need 9 million tokens to reach $20.

## How to run?
1) Simply edit the .env file and replace your API key with the one.
