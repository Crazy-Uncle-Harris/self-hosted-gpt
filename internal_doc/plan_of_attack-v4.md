# Plan of Attack for Modernizing Self-Hosted GPT (Version 4)

## Executive Summary

This document presents the fourth iteration of our plan to modernize the Self-Hosted GPT application. Building upon v3, which incorporated junior developer feedback and Marketing's input on OpenAI models/pricing, this version integrates crucial feedback from our Subject Matter Expert (SME) review. The focus is on enhancing robustness, security, and performance while maintaining the core goals of cost-efficiency, feature richness, and developer accessibility. We aim for a plan that is both ambitious and pragmatic, ensuring a high-quality, secure, and maintainable application.

## SME Feedback Analysis

The SME review of v3 highlighted several key areas for improvement, confirming the plan's strengths in model support and cost awareness but recommending enhancements in:

1.  **API Key Security:** The need to address API key handling earlier in the development cycle (not just Phase 4) due to its sensitivity.
2.  **Error Handling:** The requirement for more robust error handling in code examples and implementation, covering API failures and calculation edge cases.
3.  **Persistent Storage:** Recognition of `localStorage` limitations for token usage tracking and the need to consider more scalable solutions like IndexedDB for later phases.
4.  **Testing Strategy:** The necessity for a more comprehensive testing strategy, particularly around cost calculation accuracy and error scenarios.
5.  **Performance Implications:** Potential UI responsiveness issues from main-thread token counting, suggesting investigation into Web Workers.
6.  **Phase Prioritization:** Recommendation to bring security tasks forward in the implementation timeline.

This v4 plan directly addresses these points.

## 1. Dependency Updates (Unchanged from v2/v3)

The dependency update strategy remains consistent: a progressive approach to updating React (to v19), TypeScript (to 5.4.x), and Vite (to 5.x), supported by dedicated learning sessions.

## 2. OpenAI API Integration Enhancements (Updated for Robustness)

### 2.1. Updated Model Support Matrix (Unchanged from v3)

The model constants and capabilities matrix remain as defined in v3, reflecting the latest OpenAI offerings (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, etc.) and their attributes.

```typescript
// src/constants.ts (Excerpt - See v3 for full)
static readonly GPT_4_OMNI = "gpt-4o"; 
static readonly GPT_4_OMNI_MINI = "gpt-4o-mini"; 
static readonly MODEL_PRICING = { /* ... as in v3 ... */ };
static readonly MODEL_CAPABILITIES = { /* ... as in v3 ... */ };
```

### 2.2. Improved API Adapter with Cost Awareness & Error Handling (Enhanced)

We will enhance the `OpenAIAdapter` with more explicit error handling and logging.

```typescript
// Enhanced OpenAI adapter with cost tracking and error handling
class OpenAIAdapter {
  private apiKey: string;
  private static readonly MODEL_PRICING = { /* ... as in v3 ... */ };

  constructor(apiKey: string) {
    if (!apiKey) {
      console.error("API Key is missing for OpenAIAdapter");
      // Consider throwing an error or setting a 'disabled' state
    }
    this.apiKey = apiKey;
  }

  calculateCost(model: string, inputTokens: number, outputTokens: number): number | null {
    const pricing = OpenAIAdapter.MODEL_PRICING[model];
    if (!pricing) {
      console.warn(`Pricing info not found for model: ${model}`);
      return null; // Return null or 0 based on desired handling
    }
    // Ensure non-negative token counts
    inputTokens = Math.max(0, inputTokens);
    outputTokens = Math.max(0, outputTokens);
    
    const inputCost = (inputTokens / 1000000) * pricing.input;
    const outputCost = (outputTokens / 1000000) * pricing.output;
    return inputCost + outputCost;
  }

  async sendChatRequest(
    model: string,
    messages: ChatMessage[],
    options?: { /* ... */ }
  ): Promise<{ responseContent: string; usage: { promptTokens: number; completionTokens: number; totalTokens: number; estimatedCost: number | null; } } | { error: string }> {
    try {
      // Actual fetch/API call implementation here...
      // Assume 'apiResponse' contains { choices: [...], usage: { prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, total_tokens } }
      const apiResponse = await this.makeApiCall(model, messages, options); 

      if (!apiResponse || !apiResponse.usage) {
         throw new Error("Invalid API response structure received.");
      }

      const usage = apiResponse.usage;
      const estimatedCost = this.calculateCost(model, usage.prompt_tokens, usage.completion_tokens);
      
      return {
        responseContent: apiResponse.choices[0]?.message?.content || "", // Handle potential missing content
        usage: {
          promptTokens: usage.prompt_tokens,
          completionTokens: usage.completion_tokens,
          totalTokens: usage.total_tokens,
          estimatedCost: estimatedCost 
        }
      };
    } catch (error: any) {
      console.error("OpenAI API request failed:", error);
      // Provide a user-friendly error message
      const errorMessage = error.message || "Failed to communicate with OpenAI API.";
      // Potentially parse specific OpenAI error codes/messages if available
      // e.g., check for rate limits, auth errors, etc.
      return { error: errorMessage };
    }
  }

  // Placeholder for the actual API call logic
  private async makeApiCall(model: string, messages: ChatMessage[], options?: any): Promise<any> {
    // Replace with actual fetch to OpenAI endpoint
    // Handle headers, authentication, request body formatting
    console.log("Making mock API call for:", model); 
    await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 500)); // Simulate network delay
    // Return a structure matching OpenAI's response format, including usage object
    return { 
        choices: [{ message: { content: `Mock response for ${model}` } }],
        usage: { prompt_tokens: 50, completion_tokens: 100, total_tokens: 150 }
    }; 
  }
}
```

### 2.3. Enhanced Model Selection UI (Unchanged from v3)

The UI component remains as designed in v3, providing clear cost/capability ratings.

```typescript
// Enhanced model selector component (See v3 for full code)
function ModelSelector({ selectedModel, onChange }) { /* ... as in v3 ... */ }
```

### 2.4. Token Usage Display and Cost Estimator (Enhanced for Error States)

Update the display component to handle potential `null` costs or API errors gracefully.

```typescript
// Token usage and cost estimator component (Enhanced)
function TokenUsageDisplay({ conversation, model, lastApiUsage, lastApiError }) {
  // Calculation logic as in v3 (using a tokenizer like 'gpt-tokenizer')
  // Assume 'countTokens' function exists
  const [totalInputTokens, totalOutputTokens] = useMemo(() => {
      // Calculation...
      return [/* input */, /* output */];
  }, [conversation]);

  const estimatedCost = useMemo(() => {
    if (lastApiUsage) {
        return lastApiUsage.estimatedCost; // Use cost from the last successful API call
    }
    // Optional: Could attempt to estimate based on current conversation tokens if needed
    return null; 
  }, [lastApiUsage]);

  return (
    <div className="token-usage">
      {lastApiError && <div className="error-message">API Error: {lastApiError}</div>}
      <div className="token-counts">
        {/* Display token counts as before */}
      </div>
      <div className="cost-estimate">
        Last Request Cost: {estimatedCost !== null ? `$${estimatedCost.toFixed(4)}` : 'N/A'}
      </div>
       {/* Potentially add total session cost estimation here based on accumulated usage */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 3. Cost Optimization Features (Storage Considerations Added)

### 3.1. Automatic Model Selection (Unchanged from v3)

The heuristic-based `suggestModel` function remains as defined in v3. Error handling should be added if it performs I/O or complex computations.

```typescript
function suggestModel(message: string): string { /* ... as in v3 ... */ }
```

### 3.2. Token Usage Statistics and Analytics (Storage Strategy Update)

Acknowledge `localStorage` limitations and plan for future enhancement.

**Initial Implementation (Phase 2):** Use `localStorage` for simplicity, suitable for single-user, single-browser scenarios. Include clear error handling for storage limits (`QuotaExceededError`).

```typescript
// Store usage data (Initial localStorage version with error handling)
function recordTokenUsage(usage: TokenUsageRecord) {
  try {
    const records = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('tokenUsageRecords') || '[]');
    records.push(usage);
    // Optional: Implement basic log rotation/capping
    if (records.length > 1000) { // Example cap
        records.shift(); // Remove oldest record
    }
    localStorage.setItem('tokenUsageRecords', JSON.stringify(records));
  } catch (error: any) {
    if (error.name === 'QuotaExceededError') {
      console.warn("LocalStorage quota exceeded. Usage history may be incomplete.");
      // Optionally notify the user or implement more aggressive log rotation
    } else {
      console.error("Failed to record token usage:", error);
    }
  }
}
```

**Future Enhancement (Phase 4/Post-MVP):** Plan to migrate usage data storage to IndexedDB for better capacity, performance, and querying capabilities, especially if analytics become more complex. This will be a separate task with its own learning/implementation effort.

### 3.3. Message Optimization Suggestions (Unchanged from v3)

The `analyzeMessageEfficiency` function remains as defined in v3.

```typescript
function analyzeMessageEfficiency(message: string): string[] { /* ... as in v3 ... */ }
```

## 4. Security Enhancements (Prioritized & Detailed)

Addressing the SME's feedback, security, particularly API key handling, is prioritized.

### 4.1. API Key Handling (Phase 1/2 Priority)

**Initial Approach (Client-Side, Phase 1):**
*   **Input:** Provide a dedicated input field for the user's OpenAI API key.
*   **Storage:** Store the key *temporarily* in memory (React state) or potentially `sessionStorage` (cleared when the browser tab closes). **Avoid `localStorage` for the API key.**
*   **User Guidance:** Display clear warnings about the security implications of entering the key directly into the browser and advise users to use dedicated, secure environments. Explain that the key is only stored locally for the current session.
*   **No Hardcoding:** Ensure the key is never hardcoded in the source.

**Future Enhancement (Server-Side Proxy, Phase 4/Post-MVP):**
*   Plan for a simple optional backend proxy (e.g., Node.js/Cloud Function) that stores the user's key securely (e.g., environment variable, secure vault) and forwards requests to OpenAI. This keeps the key off the client entirely but adds deployment complexity. This will be optional for users who prefer maximum security.

### 4.2. Data Storage Security (Conversation/Usage History)

*   **Initial (Phase 2/3):** Data stored in `localStorage` (usage stats) or `IndexedDB` (conversations) is inherently client-side and subject to browser security models. It's not encrypted by default beyond the user's OS-level disk encryption.
*   **Junior Dev Feedback:** Acknowledge the complexity of client-side encryption (`feedback.md`). Defer mandatory encryption.
*   **Future Enhancement (Optional, Post-MVP):** Investigate opt-in client-side encryption libraries (e.g., `SubtleCrypto` API) for conversation history if strong user demand exists, but recognize the key management challenges.

## 5. Performance Considerations (Token Counting)

### 5.1. Initial Implementation (Main Thread, Phase 1/2)

*   Start with token counting (using a library like `gpt-tokenizer`) on the main thread for simplicity.

### 5.2. Performance Monitoring & Optimization (Phase 3/4)

*   **Monitor:** Actively monitor UI responsiveness during development and testing, especially when handling large conversations.
*   **Web Worker Investigation:** If performance degradation is observed, create a dedicated task in Phase 3 or 4 to investigate and potentially implement token counting within a Web Worker to offload the main thread. Provide learning resources for Web Workers.

## 6. Testing Strategy (Enhanced)

Expand on the testing approach from v3:

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   `calculateCost`: Test with various models (valid, invalid), token counts (zero, positive, large numbers), edge cases (null inputs).
    *   `OpenAIAdapter`: Mock API calls, test successful responses, various API error conditions (network errors, 4xx/5xx status codes), correct extraction of usage data, handling of null costs.
    *   Token Counting Functions: Test accuracy against known examples.
    *   Storage Functions (`recordTokenUsage`): Test adding records, handling storage limits (`QuotaExceededError`), retrieving data.
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   Test the flow from UI interaction (sending message) -> API call -> response display -> cost update.
    *   Test model selection UI updating the adapter correctly.
*   **Manual Testing:** Focus on UI responsiveness, error message clarity, cost display accuracy across different scenarios, security aspects (API key not persisting inappropriately).

## 7. Feature Prioritization & Implementation Strategy (Revised)
